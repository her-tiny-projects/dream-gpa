# [About Dream GPA:](https://dream-gpa.onrender.com/)
**Dream GPA** is my tiny project to assist FTU students with planning their studies systematically and strategically. This tool is especially helpful for students aiming for a high GPA to achieve scholarship or graduate with hornors, or for ones trying to balance multiple commitments like study, part-time job, and extracurricular activities.
