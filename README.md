# [**About Dream GPA:**](https://dream-gpa.onrender.com/)
**Dream GPA** is my tiny project to assist FTU students with planning their studies systematically and strategically. This tool is especially helpful for students aiming for a high GPA to achieve scholarship or graduate with honors, or for ones trying to balance multiple commitments like study, part-time job, and extracurricular activities.

## **Usecases:**
- Map out different paths to achieve target GPA
- Estimate maximum GPA based on your current performance
- Keep track of your learning progress interactively
